  "content": "Code quality is good. The args module is cleanly separated and testable in isolation, following the dependency injection principle from the project guidelines. The parseArgs function accepts argv as a parameter rather than reading process.argv directly, making it unit-testable. The index.ts entry point is concise and delegates all logic to the modules. Interactive mode correctly writes the prompt indicator to stderr to keep stdout clean for piping, matching the design specification. Tests are well-organized: unit tests for args parsing logic, integration tests for end-to-end CLI behavior. Two observations: (1) The interactive mode skips empty lines (line === \"\"), which is a sensible UX choice but is undocumented and untested. (2) The args parser does not validate or reject unknown flags, which means typos like --scenaro would silently result in 'Missing required --scenario flag' rather than a more helpful 'Unknown flag: --scenaro' error. Neither is a blocking issue.",
