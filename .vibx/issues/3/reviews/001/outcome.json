  "content": "Yes, this diff achieves the desired outcome. All 24 tests pass (7 in args.test.ts, 8 in cli.test.ts, plus the pre-existing 9 tests for matcher and scenario). The CLI supports both -p and interactive modes as specified. The error handling wraps both parseArgs and loadScenarioFile in a try/catch that prints to stderr and exits with code 1, which addresses the resilience gap noted in the issue #2 review. Integration tests verify end-to-end behavior including exit codes, stdout content, and stderr prompt indicators. The implementation is ready to serve as a drop-in replacement for Claude Code in pipeline/script contexts as described in the problem statement.",
