  "content": "Code quality is good. The create-scenario module is clean, focused, and follows dependency injection as the codebase conventions require. The PromptFunctions interface is well-typed and minimal. The mockPrompts helper in tests is straightforward. The arg parsing addition follows the existing pattern exactly (else-if chain, post-loop validation). One minor observation: in index.ts, the destructured rename `createScenario: shouldCreateScenario` is a reasonable way to avoid the naming collision with the imported function, but importing the function under an alias (e.g., `import { createScenario as runCreateScenario }`) would be slightly more idiomatic and keep the destructuring cleaner. This is a nitpick, not a blocker.\n",
