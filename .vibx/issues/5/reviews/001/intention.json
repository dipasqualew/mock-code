  "content": "The diff aligns well with the stated intention. All specified requirements are addressed: the --create-scenario flag is added, @inquirer/prompts is used, the interactive loop collects pattern/message pairs with a confirm prompt, output goes to stdout as JSON, and mutual exclusivity with -p/--scenario is enforced. The dependency injection approach for prompt functions matches the codebase guidance in CLAUDE.md. One gap: the issue mentions \"CLI test confirming --create-scenario triggers the wizard flow\" but the CLI tests only cover the error cases (flag conflicts). There is no CLI-level test that actually exercises the happy path of the wizard through the real binary, though this is understandable since driving an interactive TTY prompt from a subprocess test is non-trivial. The unit tests in create-scenario.test.ts cover the happy path adequately via DI.\n",
