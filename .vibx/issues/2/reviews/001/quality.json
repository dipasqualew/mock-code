  "content": "Code quality is good overall. The code is concise, readable, and well-structured. Dependency injection is properly applied: the matcher accepts responses as a parameter rather than loading them. The scenario loader and matcher are cleanly separated as required. Types are defined in their own module. Tests are well-organized with clear test names. A few observations: (1) The scenario loader uses Bun.file().json() which is idiomatic for Bun. (2) The matcher gracefully handles invalid regex by catching and continuing. (3) The index.ts entry point is minimal and delegates to the modules. (4) The scenario.test.ts uses import.meta.dir for fixture paths, which is Bun-idiomatic. One minor style note: the scenario loader does not validate that the JSON file exists before attempting to read it, but Bun.file().json() will throw a clear error in that case, so this is acceptable.\n",
