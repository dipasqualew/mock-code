  "content": "Yes, this diff will achieve the desired outcome. I verified that bun test passes all 9 tests across 2 files, and bun build --compile produces a binary without errors. The four deliverables from the issue are met: project scaffolding, scenario file loader, regex matching engine, and unit tests. The dependency injection design is followed. The one gap worth flagging: a .gitignore file is missing, which means node_modules and compiled binaries could be accidentally committed. This should be added before or alongside the commit.\n",
