  "content": "The diff aligns well with the stated intention. All four desired outcomes are addressed: (1) Project scaffolding is present with package.json, tsconfig.json, bun:test, and a build script. (2) The scenario file loader in scenario.ts reads and validates JSON. (3) The regex matching engine in matcher.ts uses dependency injection as required, accepting responses as a parameter. (4) Unit tests cover match found, no match, first-match-wins, invalid regex, and empty responses. The module structure matches the design exactly: src/index.ts, src/matcher.ts, src/scenario.ts, src/types.ts. One minor gap: there is no .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and build artifacts, which is a standard scaffolding concern but was not explicitly listed in the issue.\n",
